# Steam Charts Analysis

An analysis of games according to their ranking on steamcharts.com. Using Requests and BeautifulSoup, I scraped data from steamcharts and steam and compiled a small dataset of the 1000 most played games on Steam. Ultimately, I find that Valve has by far the most popular games in terms of in-game time, with nearly 1 trillion hours  played across 17 games. Not only does Valve have the most played game of all time, with [Counterstrike Source: Global Offensive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/), but they also hold the 3rd and 6th spots as well with [DOTA 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/) and [Team Fortress 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/)

Looking instead at the games by publisher, we see that Valve absolutely dominates the list with more than double the combined playtime as Amazon Games.

I was shocked by how much people have played, so I wanted to give myself a better reference than hundreds of millions of hours. I converted the hour count into years (24 hours in a day, 365.25 days in a year), only to find that Valve games have amassed nearly 100,000 years of combined playtime! To put that into perspective, modern humans first appeared about 300,000 years ago, and the first recorded use of symbols by humans was 120,000 years ago (https://phys.org/news/2021-02-prehistoric-bone-etchings-believed-oldest.html).

Combining just the top 10 most played games reveals a combined playtime of 195,228 years, and all 1000 most popular games together have a combined playtime of 442,651 years. In other words, since Steam was launched as a service on September 12, 2003 PC gamers have logged 50% more gametime than human beings have existed. Talk about time well spent!
